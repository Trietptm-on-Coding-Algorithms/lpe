# lpe

*lpe* is the collection of verified Linux kernel exploits.

*lpe* is based on the tool [out-of-tree](https://out-of-tree.io/) ([documentation](https://out-of-tree.readthedocs.io/)) and allows collaborative work on Linux kernel exploits without too much complexity.

The end goal is to collect all public exploits that **actually work**.
